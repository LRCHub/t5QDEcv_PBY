[00:00.47] I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
[00:14.46] Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
[00:22.77] I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
[00:31.66] You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
[00:40.22] Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
[00:49.31] Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
[00:56.95] You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
[01:07.04] And I'm just a child who longs on her knees
[01:28.54] 
[01:14.79] But I found a boy who I love more
[01:20.85] Than I ever did you before
[01:25.09] So stand beside the river I cried
[01:29.22] And lay yourself down
[01:35.48] Look how you want me now that I don't need you
[01:58.48] 
[01:42.93] So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
[01:56.88] At the first sight of you crawlin' back to me
[02:04.15] To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"
[02:08.73] 'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
[02:17.37] I won't stand by you
[02:27.37] 
[02:22.17] 'Cause I found a boy who I love more
[02:27.85] Than I ever did you before
[02:31.96] So stand beside the river I cried
[02:36.36] And lay yourself down
[02:42.25] Look how you want me now that I don't need you
[03:05.25] 
[02:50.36] I ain't yours for no takin'
[02:54.72] You must be mistaken
[02:57.59] I could never look into your eyes
[03:00.53] And settle for wrong and ignore the right
[03:21.03] 
[03:04.15] When I found a boy who loves me more
[03:08.14] Than you ever did before
[03:12.38] So stand beside the river you cried
[03:16.63] And lay yourself down
[03:22.72] Look how you want me now, but I don't need you
